Project Description
 
This project implements a platform-agnostic Module. UI-independent application
elements can be implemented here (Business Objects, Controllers, etc.). The root project
folder contains the Module.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits ModuleBase.
This class can be designed with the Module Designer that allows
you to view and customize Module components: referenced modules, Controllers
and business classes. Additionally, the root folder contains Application Model
difference files (XAFML files) that keep application settings specific for the
current Module. Difference files can be designed with the Model Editor.
